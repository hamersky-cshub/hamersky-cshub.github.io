00:07.566 --> 00:09.000
Hi there!

00:09.165 --> 00:11.465
Welcome to this video, where we are going to learn

00:11.865 --> 00:15.000
about digital systems and the digital environment.

00:15.065 --> 00:18.200
The goal of the presentation is to help you understand

00:18.561 --> 00:20.265
what a digital environment is

00:20.465 --> 00:23.365
and what the building blocks of digital systems are.

00:23.365 --> 00:28.065
In the video, firstly, we will look at what we mean by digital devices.

00:28.065 --> 00:32.400
Following this, we will explore what we mean by a digital environment.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.600
Finally, we will take a look at what the building blocks of digital systems are.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.250
People in today’s world spend a lot of time using digital devices!

00:46.500 --> 00:47.100
Computers,

00:47.300 --> 00:47.900
smartphones,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.500
and tablets are examples of digital devices 

00:51.000 --> 00:53.500
that make up the digital environment around us.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.600
Digital devices help us with work and school,

00:56.600 --> 00:59.400
as well as with family and leisure activities.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.300
People work online with their peers on the same project,

01:03.400 --> 01:05.800
we can go online to pay bills or apartment rent,

01:05.800 --> 01:07.500
and we can watch TV shows

01:07.500 --> 01:10.500
and buy tickets to a sports event on our digital devices.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.100
People also use various application programs,

01:14.100 --> 01:17.400
commonly called apps, to study and communicate.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.200
We send messages and photos using messaging apps.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.700
People can play games on their devices alone

01:24.700 --> 01:26.500
or with friends who are far away.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.100
In short,

01:28.100 --> 01:31.800
most of us cannot imagine our lives without digital devices.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.700
Not all of the digital devices we use

01:36.900 --> 01:39.000
are a part of the digital environment.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.500
A digital environment is any environment

01:42.500 --> 01:45.500
where your digital device is connected to the internet.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.900
Typically, a food mixer and a vacuum cleaner

01:48.900 --> 01:51.600
are non-digital electric home appliances.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.100
Some digital home appliances have mini-computers inside them.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.400
For example,

01:57.400 --> 02:01.000
a washing machine has a mini-computer to manage washing programs.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.500
Such devices can sometimes be updated using special tools

02:05.700 --> 02:08.700
that connect to the appliance using another connection type,

02:08.700 --> 02:10.500
for example, Bluetooth.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.800
Not all of these appliances are connected to the internet.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.700
However, a refrigerator with a wireless internet connection

02:18.700 --> 02:20.800
is part of the digital environment.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.000
Owners could use mobile or web applications

02:24.100 --> 02:28.300
to check humidity, temperature, or appliance status data.

02:28.500 --> 02:32.300
Digital devices also include computers and smartphones.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.300
All digital devices and internet connected appliances

02:36.300 --> 02:38.700
make up what we call a personal network.

02:38.700 --> 02:43.000
What devices are part of your personal network?

02:44.500 --> 02:46.700
How do these digital devices work?

02:46.700 --> 02:50.100
Digital systems help our digital devices to work,

02:50.100 --> 02:51.600
and these systems are built with

02:51.700 --> 02:55.700
computer programs and applications are called Software.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.200
Software is a broad term that includes 

02:58.300 --> 03:02.100
games, online educational systems, text editing tools,

03:02.200 --> 03:05.700
and booking systems to buy tickets or rent apartments.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.800
Software can be standalone or remote.

03:10.100 --> 03:14.000
Standalone software is installed on the user’s personal device.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
For example,

03:15.200 --> 03:18.700
personal digital devices have operating system software,

03:18.700 --> 03:21.300
which enables all of the device’s functions

03:21.300 --> 03:23.800
and controls the installation of applications

03:23.800 --> 03:26.300
such as games or a work-related program.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
The installed applications use

03:29.500 --> 03:32.800
the computing resources and settings of the personal device.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.500
You may have noticed

03:34.600 --> 03:37.800
that older devices have fewer computing resources.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.200
For example,

03:39.200 --> 03:42.300
maybe you have an old computer, phone, or gaming system

03:42.300 --> 03:45.900
that cannot run new games that require more computing resources.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.400
In comparison,

03:50.400 --> 03:54.000
other computer programs and applications are connected to

03:54.000 --> 03:58.600
the internet and these online systems run on remote computers.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.200
These remote computers are located somewhere else,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.500
often far away from the user.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.600
Access to online systems happens thanks to

04:07.700 --> 04:11.400
software installed locally, on the personal device.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.100
In most cases, people need Browsers to access online systems.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.200
We can think of local software programs

04:19.200 --> 04:22.600
as opening a “portal” to powerful online resources.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.200
Standalone applications can work offline.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.800
For example, some games allow users to play without the internet.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.000
However, they can be connected to the internet to send data,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.600
or retrieve data from, to remote computers upon request.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.100
For example, the results are sent to a remote computer

04:43.200 --> 04:44.600
when the internet is available.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
That way, the remote computer can make

04:47.000 --> 04:49.800
a game leader board after getting the results.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
However, many games are only functional with the internet, 

04:54.000 --> 04:55.400
such as multiplayer games

04:55.400 --> 04:58.100
that allow several users to play together in real time. 

04:58.800 --> 05:02.700
Thus, a locally installed game application sends data

05:02.700 --> 05:06.500
about the user’s actions to a remote computer without any delay.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.800
Which of your digital devices use remote software

05:10.800 --> 05:13.800
to connect to the internet?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.500
So in this short video we learnt that

05:17.800 --> 05:19.700
We are part of the digital environment

05:19.700 --> 05:22.900
when we are using devices that are connected to the internet.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.400
The digital systems we use

05:25.400 --> 05:28.800
such as smartphones, gaming consoles, and computers

05:28.800 --> 05:32.700
work because of software that is either standalone or remote.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.800
Thank you for watching.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.800
To learn more about digital environments and digital citizenship
